### Free Plan

### When I move from the Free plan to a paid plan, how many users should I pay for?

The Free plan comes with 25 free users or mailboxes of 5GB storage each. When you are in need of more than 25 users, you'll have to upgrade to a paid plan wherein, all user mailboxes will be upgraded to the higher, paid plan storage along with additional features. So, you will have to pay for all users, including the 25 existing users.

### What happens if I do not wish to renew a paid plan?

Your account will be downgraded to our free plan with 3 first account email Pro. The other user accounts will be deactivated. 

The email data will be available for export for a limited time period.
